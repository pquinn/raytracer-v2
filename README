 --- Raytracer v0.2 ---
  Currently, running "mvn build" in the base directory will end in success
  Just run raytracer-v2.jar

 --- To do ---
  - look at some kind of packaging
  - refactor for miltithreaded architecture
  - add tests
  - check correctness. (not sure 3s even renders in the right way)
  - change from standard input to file picker
  - add JavaDoc style comments
